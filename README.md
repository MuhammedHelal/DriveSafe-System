🚀 DriveSafe: Autonomous & Cooperative AI System for Next-Gen Road SafetyDriveSafe is an industry-defining graduation project that establishes a complete ecosystem for road safety. It features AI-powered driver monitoring, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, an Automated Emergency Response System with Autonomous Control, and real-time traffic management to ensure maximum safety for the driver and the surrounding vehicles.✨ System Pillars: Safety, Autonomy, and CooperationThe core functionality has been expanded to cover every phase of a critical incident, from detection to autonomous resolution.Feature CategoryDescriptionImplementation Highlight🚨 Autonomous Takeover & ParkingCRITICAL SAFETY PROTOCOL: If the system detects the driver is unconscious or incapacitated (combining AI, physiological, and motion data), it initiates autonomous control, bringing the vehicle to a safe stop and parking it out of the flow of traffic.Required implementation of low-level vehicle control commands (steering, braking, acceleration) via the Carla API bridge.🗺️ Dynamic Traffic Re-routingUtilizes the V2V network to broadcast the location and status of the disabled vehicle. The system then integrates with a mapping service to re-calculate and suggest optimal routes for other nearby drivers to avoid congestion or the hazard.Required integration with a Routing Service API and creation of a logic layer to inject a high-priority hazard avoidance zone.🧠 Multi-Model AI MonitoringUses multiple TFLite models for real-time detection of fatigue, distraction (e.g., phone use), and head pose from the camera feed.Achieved high FPS processing through optimized, concurrent ML model inference.🚑 Automated Emergency ResponseTriggers an immediate alert to emergency services (Ambulance) upon critical detection, transmitting the vehicle's GPS coordinates, health data, and driver ID.Implemented the secure API call logic with precise geographic data transmission.👪 Real-Time Family MonitoringSecurely streams the driver's real-time drowsiness score, physiological status (from Smart Watch), and location to designated family members.Built on a Real-time Database ([...] Firebase / other ...) for instant data synchronization.V2V Proximity AlertsPeer-to-peer communication between nearby DriveSafe-enabled vehicles to instantly share proximity danger alerts (e.g., rapid braking, autonomous parking events).Utilized [...] MQTT / Wi-Fi Direct / other P2P protocol ... for low-latency, localized data exchange.⌚ Smart Watch Data FusionIntegrates physiological data (Heart Rate, HRV) with visual AI analysis to generate the final, weighted Driver Safety Score.Developed a robust communication service (e.g., Bluetooth LE) for reliable wearable data acquisition.🕹️ Carla Simulation IntegrationAll autonomous and communication features were validated within the Carla Simulator to prove safety and functionality under complex, dynamic, and critical driving scenarios.Successfully established a stable, low-latency control and data bridge.💻 Technologies & System ArchitectureThis project spans multiple disciplines: Mobile, AI, Robotics/Autonomy, and Network Communication.I.

Simulation & TestingSimulator: Carla SimulatorMiddleware: Python scripts acting as the interface between the simulation, the autonomous control logic, and the Flutter application.👨‍💻 My Role: Principal Engineer - Autonomy and NetworkMy primary achievement was designing and implementing the autonomous control loop and the cooperative V2X network logic, transforming the project from a monitoring app into a fully reactive safety system.Key Technical Contributions:Autonomous Control Logic: Designed and implemented the autonomous decision tree. This logic receives the critical safety status, calculates the safe trajectory, and translates it into specific, safe vehicle control commands (e.g., move slowly to shoulder, engage hazard lights, apply parking brake).Dynamic Traffic Management Layer: Developed the backend service that consumes the V2V danger broadcast, interacts with the mapping API, and re-calculates alternative routes, feeding this information back to nearby DriveSafe users.Critical Safety Protocol Implementation: Coded the end-to-end sequence for a critical event, ensuring synchronous triggering of the Emergency Autonomy, Ambulance Notification, and V2V Hazard Broadcast in milliseconds.System Integration & Robustness: Guaranteed the reliability of the entire system across all communication protocols (Bluetooth, V2V, Carla Bridge) and safety algorithms.📸 Screenshots & DemonstrationsThis section will visually showcase the project's complexity and functionality.(Screenshots will be added here later)Autonomous Parking SequenceDynamic Traffic Re-route AlertCritical Safety Protocol Triggered[Placeholder: Screen showing "Autonomous Takeover In Progress: Parking"][Placeholder: Map view showing a recommended detour around a disabled vehicle][Placeholder: Critical status screen with "Ambulance Alert Sent" and "Autonomous Control Active"]🤝 ContactMuhammed HelalGitHub: MuhammedHelalLinkedIn: [...] Your LinkedIn Profile Link ...Project Link: https://github.com/MuhammedHelal/drive_safe
